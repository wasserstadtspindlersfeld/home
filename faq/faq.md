# Frequently asked/answered questions

## I have to paint the wall, what should I do?

The walls are painted with the `Brillux Ecofinish 947` paint. Unfortunately the smallest available package is 15 liters. If you need to get your apartment painted or apply some small fixes, it is suggested to ask in the WhatsApp group first, maybe you can team up with other people and save costs.

## The fan in the bathroom is always on, is this normal?

Yes, this is completely normal. The air vent has a humidity sensor and it will adjust the RPM of the fan accordingly, but it will never come to a complete stop. 

## How does the heating system work?

The heating system is using warm water, which is propagated to the floor heating pipes and also to the wall radiators. The controller is responsible to open/close the warm water valves at a certain temperature.

Good to know:
- The heating system is slow, if you change the controller settings it will take a while (could be day) to see the impact
- If you want to save money, set it to a comfortable level and do not change it regularly - only if you leave the apartment for a longer period
- Level 3 on the controller means ~22Â° Celsius
- If you have problems with the heating system, contact [Bock Hausverwaltung](../contacts/contacts.md#bock-hausverwaltung)

## I need to move large items, like furniture, matress or a Christmas tree - how can I do it?

If you have a driver's license, the easiest - and probably also the cheapest - way is to rent a car/van. For example with Miles, it is very simple to rent a van. Do not be afraid of the size, they are very easy to drive thanks to the huge amount of mirrors and the reverse camera. According to many people, they are easier to drive than most of the normal cars.

You can also use a classical car renting service, for example there is a [Sixt](https://maps.app.goo.gl/U9kHDZdnmJA2JeCR6) car renting office near Adlershof.

## My question is not answered here, what should I do?

## Telekom sales people are bothering me, what can I do?

As a first attempt, you can print the [Telekom notice.pdf](./resources/telekom_notice.pdf) document and stick it on your door. There is also a blacklist you can apply to, but the method is not 100% clear yet.
