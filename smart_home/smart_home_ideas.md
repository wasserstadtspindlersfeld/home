## Introduction

The main goal of this page is to give you ideas about how to have a Smart Home setup to improve the security of your home. All the recommended devices you should buy on your own (except the kit 3), but you can always use our WhatsApp group or contact me directly for support.

 Here are some typical use cases for a cool Smart Home setup:
- Get a notification on your phone if someone is in your apartment while you are away (burglars, crazy ex or just ghosts!)
- Trigger a loud alarm if someone entered your apartment without permission
- Get the intruders recorded and have the recording saved in the cloud
- Check on your pet while you are at work
- Check on the apartment if you are on a vacation
- Turn on the AC on a hot summer day so that you arrive to a cosy home after a long trip or just a night-out
- Automate the window shutters to make your plants happy, but keep the warmth inside during the night

## Frequently asked questions

**Is it safe?**
> Yes, the camera is automatically covering its lens if it is disabled, therefore it will not record you or monitor you if you are not activating it. The activation can be done remotely with your phone. 

**Do you offer installation?**
> I can provide help if needed, but most of the setups are so simple - so could definitely do it on your own. For the complex, custom setups I offer installation, but it has to be discussed separately.

**Are these recommended devices reliable?**
> Yes, they have been used for years in multiple homes in my family and we had no issues with them so far.

**Which solution do you recommend for me?**
> I would suggest to try the most simple option first and see how you like it.

**Are these devices compatible with my existing Smart Home solution?**
> It depends, Apple Homekit is supported, but Google and Alexa is depending on the device.

**Are there any requirements against my home?**
> Yes, you need a WiFi router that supports the 2.4 GHz band.
